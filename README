#iOS WeatheAPI Take Home Test#

Instructions:

    - Open Networking/Connection.swift and input API Key into the struct WeatherAPIConnection's _apiKey_ constant.

    - You may need to update the Signing to run on device, otherwise, the app should work from here.

    - Note: The instructions didn't specify which OS to target, so I targeted iOS 18.0.
